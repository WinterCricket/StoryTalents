<head>Raw List: Story Talents</head>
	<p>1. <strong>(Sem containing [act...] REF and SEM(closed for speed))</strong>	Fast development of strong, memorable, detailed characters (Bolano). A.  Via  1st pov narrators thoughts  and suppositions of characters. B. (Munro, the Eye) first person narrator about a character, Develops the character quickly and with power, as she reports what the and breaks the fictional confines (4th wall), a little meta if fiction. Usually her fiction contains mythic quality to epiphanies</p>
	<p>2. <strong>(Sem, trauma?)</strong> First person narrator who tells the story in a detached, strange way that results in extraordinary feeling at the story’s end.(Bolano; the Eye). Uses character device, a means, a filter, who perceives—this is the Eye, as though his perceiving self were a separate entity.</p>
	<p>3. <strong>(Her/Act vs Sem)</strong>	Plot contrast Emotional Plot :  Combining tonal detachment with emotional reflection and suffering.(Bolano, Phone Calls). Quick twists, turns, fast plot detached from emotion, but in contrast, narrator/mc is feeling all the emotions</p>
	<p>4.<strong>(Shape/Value Change/Beats/ Jammed HER and SYM, Open SEM)</strong> Hamlet quality: this reverse to Hamlet not having easily identifiable positive or negaitve value shift moments, and, hence, the overall movement of the story, or arc, is flat. It begins at loss (subneutral) and continues at this level to the end. One way the play achieves this is to allow a double valence: Hamlet dies, but he has found justice. He dies, but is remembered. Norways invades, but honors Hamlet...there are many neutralizing double valences for even one instance/event. Vonnegut illustrates this. He contrasts Hamlet with traditional western stories (Cinderella, etc.). He parallels Hamlet with traditional African tales, that don't have plot-like value changes and story arcs. He claimed that Hamlet is great because it is most like reality, and that its gift to us is that ambiguity of reality. It doesn't pretend to know what is good or bad.</p>
